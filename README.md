## Analysing 2024 Steam titles to understand revenue drivers.
### For my first Data Analysis project, I decided to look at Steam sales from 2024. Taking a dataset from *Kaggle* and utilising *Excel* & *Python*, working with libraries such as *Pandas*, *Numpy*, *Matplotlib* & *Seaborn*, I was able to gather insights such as:
1. Top 10 Popular Games by Revenue
2. Revenue by Publisher Class (AAA vs Indie)
3. Top Publishers by Total Revenue
4. Do Review Scores Correlate with Revenue?
5. Does Higher Price Help or Hurt Revenue?
